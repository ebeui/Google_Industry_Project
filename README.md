### Chat with SideBard
Experience the power of our customized chatbot by interacting with the Jupyter notebook [here](https://github.com/ebeui/Google_Industry_Project/blob/906403df0a490482cc0cb3e324f359718c39abe5/SideBard%20Chatbot/Play_with_Sidebard.ipynb). The notebook requires two dependencies: `function_source.py` and `google_docs.csv`.

**Question:** How do I sum all the costs of this store in Google Sheets?

**Answer:** Hello Samir! To sum all the costs of a store in Google Sheets, use the SUM function. Follow these steps:

- Select the cell where you want the sum to appear.
- Type "=SUM(" in the cell.
- Select the range of cells containing the costs you want to sum.
- Close the parentheses ")" and press Enter.

For example, if the costs are in cells A1 to A10, you would enter "=SUM(A1:A10)" in the cell. This will calculate the sum of all the costs in the specified range and display the result in the selected cell.
